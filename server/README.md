# dependencies for this project
- Express: an essential framework for NodeJS to start a server project,
- esm: This goes with babel, which you will install later, and allows you to run ES6 (New version of Javascript)
- nodemon: This is my favorite; it will enable you to restart the server automatically whenever you make changes in the server.
- babel: compiles ES6 to ES5 to compress the project size when pushing to production to reduce run-time and because many web browsers can only read ES5.
- body-parser:
- passport
- passport-jwt
- winston
- cors
- express-validator
- jsonwebtoken
